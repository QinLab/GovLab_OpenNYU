skills:
    - Quantitative methods in neuroscience
    - Computational neuroscience
    - Machine learning
    - Data analysis
    - how people and animals learn from trial and error (and from rewards and punishments) to make decisions, combining computational, neural, and behavioral perspectives
    - understanding how subjects cope with computationally demanding decision situations, notably choice under uncertainty and in tasks (such as mazes or chess) requiring many decisions to be made sequentially
    - using computational frameworks of reinforcement learning and Bayesian decision theory as a basis for analyzing and understanding biological decision making
    - Computational models in neuroscientific experiments
    - interactions between multiple decision-making systems
    - Learning and neuromodulation
