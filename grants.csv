,In-situ Studies of Morphology Evolution in Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites during Processing and Deformation,08/15/2006,07/31/2009,228641,Directorate for Engineering,"Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation","In-situ Studies of Morphology Evolution in Polymer-Clay Nanocomposites during Processing and Deformation<br/><br/>David G. Bucknall, Haskell W. Beckham and Yonathan S. Thio<br/>Georgia Institute of Technology<br/><br/>Project Abstract<br/><br/> Polymer-silicate nanocomposites will be examined in situ with X-ray scattering under large-strain conditions that mimic (1) processing and (2) deformation to fracture. Simultaneous small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering will be employed to collect real-time structural data during biaxial stretching conditions which match commercial thermal blown film processing, and during uniaxial stretching for large-strain deformation measurements. Nanocomposite samples will be characterized before and after the processing and deformation studies using complementary techniques that include transmission electron microscopy, thermal and mechanical property measurements. These experimental studies will be conducted in close cooperation with a multi-scale modeling research effort to create a predictive tool for designing nanocomposites for a given application.<br/> The proposed research will be integrated with graduate and undergraduate education at Georgia Tech and will at the same time provide opportunities for outreach to local high schools. The proposed research also has broad implications for technologies which are beginning to commercially exploit polymer-silicate nanocomposites in applications from packaging to automotive components. The empirical development of structure/property relationships in these nanocomposite materials has lead to knowledge of types of morphologies that can be formed from different starting recipes, and how this relates to their observed properties. Despite this, relatively little is known about how nanocomposite morphologies reach their characteristic forms during processing, nor how these structures deform under large-scale deformation to fracture. This knowledge, which is needed to complement the comprehensive modeling studies being undertaken by our collaborators, can be provided by conducting in-situ studies of nanocomposite processing and deformation.",0600016
,Collaborative Research: Electrowetting Micro Array Printing System for Bioactive Tissue Construct Manufacturing,04/01/2007,03/31/2010,216005,Directorate for Engineering,"Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation","The objective of this collaborative research project is to investigate the process of electrowetting on dielectric as an advanced manufacturing technology for tissue engineering. An electrowetting-based microfluidics array printing system will be created to rapidly print chitosan hydrogel and other biomaterials to build micro porous scaffolds with predefined structures, cells, and growth factors. The project addresses fundamental challenges to biocompatible dispensing of hydrogels, living cells, and growth factors, to mimic tissue extra cellular matrix architecture and support cell proliferation. Specifically, the investigators will: (1) characterize chitosan hydrogel, in terms of its mechanical strength, rheology, solidification, manufacturability, biocompatibility, and ability to support cell proliferation; (2) model, design, and demonstrate the generation of sub-nanoliter hydrogel droplets from an on-chip reservoir through electrowetting, addressing issues of biocompatibility and droplet dispensing; and (3) demonstrate and characterize the sterility, biocompatibility, and manufacturing precision of an intelligent system including software control, actuation, multiple reservoirs, and printing arrays, to manufacture scaffolds based on a computer-aided design model of myocardial tissue. <br/><br/>If successful, this project will enable tissue engineers to optimize mechanical, transport, material, and biological properties of a soft tissue engineering scaffold, with a degree of structural control, fine resolution (<10 microns) and embedded cells and growth factors not currently available. In this project, a group of graduate and undergraduate senior students will be trained in advanced manufacturing technology and tissue engineering. Several project-based learning modules will be created to strengthen the undergraduate mechanical and biomedical engineering curricula. The project will also be used in outreach workshops for local high school and community college students, including many underrepresented minority students, to showcase high-tech mechanical and electrical engineering applications in biotechnology.",0700021
,Collaborative Research on Risk Management in Supply Chains Using Market Information,06/01/2008,05/31/2012,281167,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn","NSF Proposal # 0800628: Management in Supply Chains Using Market Information<br/><br/>Abstract: <br/><br/>This grant provides funding for the development of risk management tools for supply chains using market information. Preliminary studies have shown that the demand for discretionary purchase items, such as automobiles, apparel, consumer electronics, and home furnishings is correlated with the movement of economic indicators. These findings present an opportunity to use information about market expectations embedded in the prices of financial instruments to improve demand forecasting, production planning, and inventory thus reducing risk. This project aims to establish that the market indicators can be used to plan inventories in supply chains that are optimal not just in a static sense but also dynamically, and to test whether and how the value of the firm is correlated with the economic indicators driving the forecasts. The proposed work also includes the examination of the effect of price information on inventories when the price of the product can be forecasted using prices of traded market instruments. <br/><br/>The project consists of four parts: forecasting, optimal decision-making, hedging, and empirical validation. If successful, this research will lead to better understanding of the connections between economic factors with supply chain demand and inventory planning. The results will provide a mechanism to inventory planners to use readily available and reliable market information for inventory planning, profit forecasting, and hedging purposes. They also provide a systematic method for developing and testing profit and risk equations using models of supply chains, and allow the enterprises to better understand how the cost of procurement and the volatility of prices and demand affect risk in a simple and joint manner, and thus, the firms will be able to make use of market factors in designing inventory and production systems.",0800004
,"GOALI: Control of Cyclic Systems - Theory, Applications, and Experiments",08/15/2009,07/31/2013,299998,Directorate for Engineering,"Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation","The research objective of this award is the development of a control theory for cyclic systems and its application and experimental verification. Cyclic systems contain mechanical devices that rotate, along with actuators and sensors that are fixed in inertial space. The combination of rotating motion and inertially-fixed inputs and outputs leads to one-per-revolution (or stroboscopic) actuation and sensing. The research will result in methods that are applicable to xerographic processes, drilling and milling machines, and turbomachinery. The approach of the research is based on so-called circulant matrices, which describe cyclic systems. Each row of a circulant matrix is a circular permutation of the previous row. Fundamental properties of circulant matrices constitute the foundation of the theoretical part of the research; the experimental part is based on the xerographic process. Deliverables include: (1) Methods for mathematical modeling of cyclic systems; (2) Methods for stabilizability, controllability, and observability of cyclic systems; (3) Methods for designing reference tracking and disturbance rejection controllers for cyclic systems; (4) Application of the results obtained to the photoreceptor charging system in xerography to reduce color variation; (5) Experimental verification of the techniques developed; (6) Documentation of the research results; (7) Engineering student education. <br/><br/><br/>If successful, the results of this research will provide a methodology for improving performance of rotating devices using feedback control. Indeed, in many instances, high performance of rotating devices is achieved using expensive high quality hardware. Based on the methods to be developed, high performance will be achieved using inexpensive low quality hardware but with stroboscopic feedback control. The results of this research will be disseminated to industrial audiences through short courses. Graduate students involved in this GOALI project will be exposed to industrial environment at Xerox Research Center. Efforts will be made to involve under-represented minorities and women to this project as well as high school students.",0900004
,Collaborative Research: Investigation of Odor-triggered Neuronal Dynamics and Experience-induced Olfactory Learning,09/15/2012,08/31/2015,355586,Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences,Division of Mathematical Sciences,"This research project will uncover neuronal network mechanisms that allow animals to recognize, and learn to recognize, different odors in their dynamic environment. The early stages of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta's olfactory system generate odor-specific responses which are spatiotemporally complex. Electrophysiological experiments, in conjunction with conditioning trials, will be carried out to determine which features of the complex response are in fact relevant to the moth's adaptive encoding of its olfactory environment, and how these features are resculpted when the moth learns to appreciate a new odor. Specifically, we will direct experiments measuring (a) high-order dynamical structures associated with odor-response in the hawkmoth's antennal lobe and other synaptic centers including the lateral protocerebrum and mushroom bodies, and (b) the plasticity-induced shift in these structures following a conditioning paradigm. These experiments will facilitate development of both computational and theoretical models of neuronal networks. Specifically, we will develop (c) a large-scale spiking network model of the hawkmoth olfactory system which will be benchmarked using the experiments mentioned above, and (d) a theoretical framework capable of analyzing the rich dynamics found in these networks.<br/><br/>An abundance of recent experiments indicate that insects as well as other animals such as mammals, primates and humans, exhibit brain states that are incredibly rich, some directly induced by stimuli and some born from learning processes, all possessing dynamic properties on a variety of scales. The intricacies of these dynamic regimes are still a mystery. We currently do not know what these brain states are capable of, nor how they are used to drive decision making or learning. The hawkmoth -- ""Manduca sexta"" -- has a brain which is considerably simpler than a human's, but nevertheless has an olfactory system not too dissimilar from our own. By investigating the link between neuronal network dynamics, behavior and learning within this animal, we will draw conclusions relevant to some of our basic cognitive functions.",1200004
,Identification and Control for Pattern Steering in Dynamical Networks,08/01/2013,07/31/2016,360000,Directorate For Engineering,"Div Of Civil, Mechanical, & Manufact Inn","The objective of this project is to develop an infrastructure for the identification and steering of complex dynamical patterns in networks and spatiotemporal systems, tools for the goal of pattern steering include complex attractor reconstruction, state identification, and appropriate control protocols. Computational methods for changing the activity of a complex dynamical network from one state to another will be investigated. Complicated nonlinear networks appear to be multi-stable and multi-rhythmic, a mix of chaotic and periodic stable attractors, together with other metastable transients that may be effectively stable for the time interval of an engineering application. Computational methods will be developed to enable steering between these attractors, or dynamical patterns, and to perform this switching quickly and automatically. The project includes theoretical, computational, and experimental components. In particular, foundational work on adaptive Kalman filtering will be carried out that was motivated by previous exploratory work. Spiking networks with multiple attractors will be studied theoretically and hypotheses tested by simulation, as a proof of concept of steering techniques. Larger networks will be designed as a bridge to experiments. A new data-driven computational method called Diffusion-Mapped Delay Coordinates, a result of previous exploratory study, will be used for steering between basins of attractors. The developed methodologies will be tested in two different experimental platforms, neuronal cell cultures, and convection rolls in nematic liquid crystals. <br/><br/>This work provides potentially pathbreaking contributions to the analysis and effective control of dynamical and spiking biological, bio-inspired, and more general engineering networks. Better understanding of this test case could be a first step to new approaches to optimization of energy transfer and production. The experimental examples have in common a lack of known equations of motion, which severely limits the use of classical control theory and motivates development of our new techniques. Throughout this study, emphasis will be placed on development of methodologies that generalize widely to other multistable dynamical networks. The project will provide concrete interdisciplinary training for graduate and postdoctoral students, who will be chosen from three different background areas, physics, mathematics, and engineering.",1300007
